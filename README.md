# Image Classification API: Deep Learning Powered Web Service

This project showcases a web service built for image classification, leveraging a pre-trained deep learning model developed with TensorFlow. The API, constructed using FastAPI, allows users to upload images and receive real-time predictions about the image's content. This project demonstrates the seamless integration of deep learning models with web technologies, providing a practical example of deploying machine learning solutions.

## Project Overview

This API serves as a bridge between a trained TensorFlow model and end-users. It allows for image uploads, processes them through the deep learning model, and returns the predicted class along with a confidence score. The core of the project lies in the deep learning model, which is designed to recognize patterns and features within images. The web service wraps this model, making it accessible through a simple HTTP interface.

**Key Features:**

* **Deep Learning Model Integration:** Utilizes a pre-trained TensorFlow model for image classification.
* **Real-time Predictions:** Provides immediate results upon image upload.
* **User-Friendly API:** Built with FastAPI for a clean and efficient web service.
* **Image Processing:** Handles image resizing and normalization for model compatibility.
* **Deployment Ready:** Designed for easy deployment on platforms like Render.

## Deep Learning Model

The heart of this project is a deep learning model, trained to classify images into predefined categories. The model's architecture and training process are crucial for its accuracy. This API assumes the existence of a pre-trained model file (`model.h5` or similar), which is loaded and used for inference.

**Model Characteristics:**

* The model is designed for image classification.
* It expects images of a specific size (e.g., 150x150 pixels).
* The model outputs class probabilities, which are then converted to predicted classes.
* The accuracy of the API depends heavily on the model's training data and architecture.

## Web Service

The web service, built with FastAPI, provides a simple interface for interacting with the deep learning model. Users can upload images via a POST request to the `/predict` endpoint. The API then processes the image, passes it to the model, and returns the prediction results.

**API Functionality:**

* **Image Upload:** Accepts image files through a POST request.
* **Prediction:** Uses the loaded TensorFlow model to predict the image's class.
* **Result Output:** Returns the predicted class and confidence score in JSON format.
* **Error Handling:** Provides informative error messages for invalid inputs or processing failures.

## Deployment on Render

This project is designed for easy deployment on Render, a cloud platform that simplifies web service deployment.

**Deployment Steps (Brief):**

1.  **Create a Render Web Service:** Set up a new web service on Render.
2.  **Connect Your Repository:** Link your GitHub or GitLab repository to Render.
3.  **Configure Environment:** Specify the Python version and install dependencies using a `requirements.txt` file.
4.  **Set Start Command:** Use `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 10000` or a similar command to start the API.
5.  **Deploy:** Render will build and deploy your application.

**Dependencies:**

* `tensorflow==2.17.1`: For deep learning model inference.
* `fastapi`: For building the web API.
* `uvicorn`: For running the FastAPI application.
* `python-multipart`: For handling file uploads.
* `Pillow (PIL)`: For image processing.
* `numpy`: For numerical operations.
* `matplotlib`: (Optional) for possible image visualization during model development.

## Usage

To use the API, send a POST request to the `/predict` endpoint with an image file attached. The API will return a JSON response containing the predicted class and confidence score.

**Example (curl):**

```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@path/to/your/image.jpg" [your-render-url]/predict
